<p>They sit around a dinner table, sheltered in the warmth of friends and food, bulwarks against the dark and rainy night, both within and without. Eight people, for whom this common table is the tangible evidence of metaphysical truth.</p>
<p>Laughter and joy fill the room. Conversation flows easily, story lines are synchronized and updates offered.</p>
<p>The joyful interactions are not a veil, but a balm. This family, gathered around this table, comforts each other in love.</p>
<p>Dinner is on the table, a handmade relic with fading value. The family finds joy in the simple pleasure of a meal, around a shared table. Feasting in the light of truth already known, and beauty yet to come.</p>
<p>The host serves his brothers out of love, his hands doing the work of the one who is not seen. A woman comforts her hurting sister, her loving arms standing in for a future embrace.</p>
<p>As the table is cleared, burdens are laid out. A cluttered sink of dirty dishes is left to sit, passed over in favor of the broken people gathered here.</p>
<p>Honesty reigns, and confessions flow. Fear of change and the future ahead. Fear of the past and pain not left behind. A knowing greed for time and comfort. Identity lost in the midst of suffering. Doubt. Brokenness. Lies.</p>
<p>But hope does not founder. A chorus of voices speak a healing truth, even through the mist of their pain. Light bathes the table.</p>
<p>Confidence in our future hope breaks fear's grip. Hope loosens the hold of the past. Repentance is sought. Love comforts. Restores.</p>
<p>The table bears the weight of all.</p>
