<p>I don't know if it makes me shallow or not a real writer or something, but my writing often depends on being in a specific mood. Right now, it's 50-something degrees outside, and there's a light rain. The window is open, and I have a mug of hot tea in hand. On the screen in front of me is a project that I'm excited about.</p>
<p>This is the perfect setting for me. I love it.</p>
