    <p>I was really skeptical about <a href="http://amzn.to/1T47LQL">Rod Dreher’s new book <em>How Dante Can Save Your Life</em></a>. When he started writing about it on his blog I wasn’t interested—at all. I started skipping posts about Dante. After being deeply affected by his two previous books I was not even going to read this one.</p>

<p>I was wrong, and I’m glad I was.</p>

<p>I decided to read it when he started talking about how it intersected with his life. As relayed in his last book, <a href="http://amzn.to/1OhZrbK"><em>The Little Way of Ruthie Leming</em></a>, Rod struggled mightily with family issues of loyalty, trust and place. When I realized that this book would continue where the previous book left off, I decided to take a chance.</p>

<p>It was wonderful. I honestly don’t remember why I doubted it would be. Rod used light literary criticism and memoir to spin a deeply emotional and personal tale of how God works on our hearts through art. This was right up my alley, and I was going to pass it by.</p>

<p>As a reader, you don’t have to know anything about Dante or his <em>Divine Comedy</em> to read and appreciate this book. Rod’s careful treatment and plain-spoken approach make it an approachable experience for all readers. But in doing so he does not shy away from the complexities of the work.</p>

<p>It was a wonderfully fun read, I ripped through it in just a few days. If this sounds even slightly interesting to you I highly recommend it.</p>
