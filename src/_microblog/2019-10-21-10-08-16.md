[In the latest issue of my newsletter](https://thenarrative.substack.com/p/conflict-in-the-mundane), I write about a wonderful poem I discovered earlier this year by @cberesforddunne, and how it is a beautiful example of exploring conflicting ideals. The easy and accessible way in which this poem explores the messy joy of family life in light of the things sacrificed for it shows clearly how the best poems use conflicting ideas to explore human experience. It’s a poem that’s both worth your time and worth considering deeply.
