I am a writer and storyteller. I currently serve as the Lead Writer for Austin Stone Worship. I am passionate about writing, literature, and stories of redemption. For the last nine years I have been a part of the Austin Stone Story Team, where I have led artists and taught on writing, storytelling, and faith. I also serve on the leadership team that defined and launched the Writer Development Program at The Austin Stone, where I regularly teach and coach writers.

I went to school at Oklahoma State University to study journalism, switched majors, and then graduated with an MIS degree in 2001. Brian was a developer, project manager, and strategist at Dell, Inc. until early 2015 when he joined the staff of The Austin Stone Community Church. Brian and his family live in Taylor, TX.
