I blazed through the 104 pages of this book in just a few days. I will be urging lots of my fellow Story Teamers to read it. ItÂ is a powerful argument for the need for artists to step forward and start renewing our decaying culture.

<em><a href="http://store.internationalartsmovement.org/collections/books/products/culture-care">Culture Care</a></em> is a sustained argument that articulates the need for all artists, particularly Christians, to step forward into <a href="http://fujimurainstitute.org/resources/on-becoming-generative-an-introduction-to-culture-care/">thinking <em>generatively</em></a>. It is a call to establish communities and organizations dedicated to developing what Fujimura calls 'cultural estuaries' that are upstream from our culture andÂ can bring us back to beauty and truth.

It is <i>not</i> a call for more 'Christian' art, in fact Fujimura successfully shows why such a category is flawed in its most basic premise. It is a call for Christian artists, the 'border-stalkers' of our community, to function in a way that creates an ebb and flow between the church and the broader culture. He even outlines how this can serve to defuse some aspects of the culture wars.Â This book is prescriptive in nature, it does not show proven methods, rather outlines a plan for others to follow.

I am a huge fan of Fujimura'a paintings, but this book has increased my estimation of him even more. It shows solid thinking, a keen understanding of the church in America's situation, and an inside view of the artist's mind. He weaves these together into Â well thought out approach to our culture's biggest issues. He is a top-notch thinker on arts and culture, and with this book he has given believing artists and creative catalysts a lot to think about, and aspire to.
