[@manton](https://micro.blog/manton), is there any documentation on how to correctly post links in a post that&#39;s syndicated from an external microblog? In [this post of mine](https://brianlundin.com/microblog/2018-12-19-12-30-34.html) both a link and a mention of another user don&#39;t render as hyperlinks on micro.blog.
