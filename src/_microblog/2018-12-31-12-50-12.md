The truth of Christmas, that God became man in the flesh, is not only humbling, but gives me courage. He knows what our lives are like, the highs, the lows, the sufferings, and the joys. And He still gave Himself up for us.

> "Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted." Hebrews 2:17â€“18
