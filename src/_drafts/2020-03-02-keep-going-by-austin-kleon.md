My wife has gotten used to all sorts of small creative experiments and exercises that I’ve taken up over the years. From fiddling with a Rubik’s cube to occasional collaging, and now to a steady flow of ideas for how to get our little ones engaged in making art, she entertains them all. And she’s eve stopped asking where they come from. Because she knows they almost always originate from the books and [blog of Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com).

I’ve been a fan of Kleon’s since [his first book, *Steal Like an Artist*](https://amzn.to/38hiiUH) was published in 2012. It came out at an interesting time for me, one where I had been writing again for several years and starting to grapple with what that meant. To be honest it gave me a whole new view into what being a writer could—and perhaps should—be. It profoundly shaped my creative process and the way I thought about making art. His next book was influential as well, but not to the same degree (though that’s a really high bar, to be honest). Needless to say, I was looking for to his latest effort.

[*Keep Going* did not disappoint.](https://amzn.to/2ThjqTK)
