Jesus was the most productive person ever. That might sound obvious to some, or trivial to others, but I believe that truth is incredibly important to believers living in the modern world.

What do I mean when I say that? What’s my point? It’s simple really:

> Jesus always did the right thing, with the right people, at the right time, and in the right way, always.
{: .blockquote}

When we learn to do the right things, with the right people, at the right time, and in the right way, we become *more* like Jesus. For the believer the end goal of improving our productivity is actually sanctification.

Of course, there are other results and purposes behind improving our productivity. I totally agree with Matt Perman when he asserts that our productivity is about doing all that we can, with all that we have, for the glory of God. Being more productive (in the sense that Jesus was productive), absolutely leads us to love our neighbors, families, churches, communities, and the world. It leads us to a greater impact for the kingdom of God. Being more productive is absolutely about glorifying God, *as is all of life*.

But, in the day-to-day mess—especially when it’s hard to be disciplined and organized—what drives me forward is this simple idea: becoming more productive means that I am becoming more like Jesus.
