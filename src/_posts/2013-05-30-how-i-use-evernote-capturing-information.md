<p>Evernote is the most versatile tool in my digital toolbox. I use it for, what seems like, everything. I’ve<br />
heard their CEO say many times that their desire is for the service to be a 'second brain’ for their users. If I am any indication, they are well on their <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why am I taking the time to <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">write a post about a product that I have no financial stake in? Two reasons: </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">First, I love it. I genuinely do. I am a big fan of the service and the </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">company. They do things right, and I really appreciate that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, late last week I posted <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">a piece on the blog detailing my social media workflow. While it did not </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">exactly crash the Internet, it generated some good discussion in the comments. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Several of the commenters indicated that they wanted more information on how I </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">use Evernote. I like to think deeply about how I do what I do, so it sounded </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">like a really good topic to explore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this post I will cover the <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">basics of how I use Evernote and the specifics of how I capture notes. In part </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">two, I will show you how I organize my Evernote account. Then finally in part </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">three, I will discuss the applications I use with Evernote.</span></p>
<h2>What is Evernote?</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/logo.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, how about short<br />
introduction for those of you unfamiliar with the service and applications?<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is, at it’s core, a note taking application. It gives you the ability<br />
to take a note on almost any device and then access it from any other device.<br />
This may sound very basic, and not much like a second brain, but that is<br />
because what the company has done is take this very simple idea and give it<br />
wide-ranging power. From powerful search, tagging, location, image search and<br />
integration features, to their near-ubiquity on modern PC and device operating<br />
systems, Evernote gives its users the ability to remember everything they need,<br />
and more.</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have learned one clear thing<br />
in collaborating with and talking to other Evernote users: everyone has a<br />
different viewpoint on how to use it. It can be used in many different ways.<br />
That is the power of the service. What I detail in this series of posts is<br />
simply how I use the tools. It may not work for you, but I hope you can pick up<br />
something valuable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I work for a large IT solutions company with an<br />
appropriately strict IT security policy. As a result I do not use Evernote for<br />
work. I do not store company data in it; so my use of Evernote focuses on my personal<br />
life and side projects, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I use Evernote to:</p>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Archive travel and event information</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Collect and manage recipes</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Collect and review articles, tips and ideas for<br />
my writing projects before they start</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Record interviews for my work with <a href="http://austinstone.org/stories/stories-main">the Story<br />
Team</a></li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Take notes, make and use flashcards, and collect<br />
materials for my work towards an advanced theology degree</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Contact information for networking and<br />
acquaintances</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see, I use it for<br />
several different, specific goals. Your mileage will vary.</p>
<h2>Information capture (it’s more than just note-taking)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Between all of the use cases I outlined above I use a<br />
variety of tools to capture data in Evernote.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/web_clipper-75.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For information on the web<br />
(travel &amp; event info, recipes, articles and project research), I use the<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a> extensively. It may be the leading tool I use to capture<br />
data. The clipper is offered for all major browsers as an extension, and there<br />
is a bookmarklet for other browsers. I also use the option in Chrome for the<br />
clipper to search my Evernote note account when I do a Google search. This is a<br />
really useful, and little talked about, feature. Also, when reading long form<br />
articles I will use the <a href="http://evernote.com/clearly/">Evernote Clearly Chrome extension</a> for readability and<br />
to import the content into Evernote. It’s a handy little extension.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my theology classes this<br />
past year I occasionally used <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a> to capture diagrams and visual aids, but<br />
usually I did not have time while note taking to do it well. As a result, it<br />
was little used. For design collaboration it can be a great tool, but I do not<br />
rely on it heavily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I use the <a href="http://evernote.com/evernote/">Evernote Mac and<br />
Windows apps</a> for long form note taking. Whether it is in class, in meetings at<br />
church or just at home gathering information for a project, I use the PC apps<br />
extensively. I also use these apps exclusively for organizing my notes. I am<br />
careful about how I process data in Evernote, but more about that in my next<br />
post.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hello-75.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For contact information I use<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/hello/">Evernote Hello</a> for iOS. I will go into this app in more detail in a later post.<br />
It is a great app for managing contacts in Evernote, and for keeping my<br />
networking and acquaintance information out of my iPhone contacts list (which<br />
is already overcrowded).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For recording interviews for<br />
Story Team assignments I use both the Mac and iPhone apps. After a mishap with<br />
my phone during an interview a few years ago I have started using a backup. I<br />
capture the primary recording on my Mac via recording software and <a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R76D42/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001R76D42&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blundin-20">a Samson USB<br />
Go Mic</a>. After the interview I edit the start and finish, export to an mp3 and<br />
then import it into Evernote. While the Evernote client can record it directly,<br />
I like the control and options I have with this workflow. As a backup I also<br />
record the interview on my iPhone, directly into the Evernote app. Using this<br />
process I get clean audio and have not lost another interview.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, I use the iOS app to<br />
capture all physical paperwork. The image capture tools in the apps, and OCS on<br />
the Evernote servers make this a completely valid option. In fact, I have<br />
considered getting a scanner that can capture directly into the Evernote app, but<br />
the quality of the image capture and text recognition fully satisfy my<br />
requirements.</p>
<h2>Next time on the blog</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my next post I will address<br />
my process and organization techniques, and then I will cover apps in my final<br />
post of the series.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope this has been a helpful<br />
post for Evernote users, or those considering picking it up. I’m not the only<br />
user out there, and I am sure my readers have additional insight. How do you<br />
capture information in Evernote? Is there a cool tool out there I’m not aware<br />
of? Share it with us in the comments below!</p>
