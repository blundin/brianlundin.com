<p>Today we are kicking off the Austin Stone Worship Conference at the Austin Music Hall. The Story Team is happy to be a part of the conference, and to get to connect with worship leaders and artists from across the country.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/posts/cropped_asw.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's going to be a great time of teaching, worship and encouragement. The Story Team is bringing the Story Team Trailer back to gather interviews and stories from conference goers, as well as operating the Story Team Lounge. In the Lounge we will have a gallery of our <a href="http://austinstone.org/stories/written">written work</a> and <a href="http://austinstone.org/stories/photo">photography</a>, as well as computers where you can see <a href="http://austinstone.org/stories/film">our films</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the conference is today, and may not be able to register and get to us in time, but that's okay! <a href="http://live.austinstoneworship.com/">The good folks at Austin Stone Worship have a live stream for the conference, so you can watch at home!</a></p>
<p>Today is also the launch of the new Austin Stone Album, <em>King of Love</em>. It is a fantastic album, with both new and old songs. There are some some really, really great songs on this record. I'm really proud of my friends who put so much into this album, I really think it is a blessing to the church. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/king-of-love/id697126496">You can buy it on iTunes today</a>, and I highly suggest you do!</p>
