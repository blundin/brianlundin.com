As a writer and a storyteller, reading is essentialâ€”it's the raw material of my craft. This is a list of books I'm reading and I've read since January of 2020.

## 2020

### ðŸ“– Reading now

[ðŸ“– *Big Wonderful Thing: A History of Texas* by Stephen Harrigan.](https://amzn.to/37y3TTN) The title is right. This is a big, wonderful read. It's a history of Texas that tells the history of this incredible state through the eyes of those who lived it. It looks at the atrocities and the triumphs alike with sober-minded realism. If you love Texasâ€”or are simply intrigued by itâ€”this is a great read.

[ðŸ“– *Adorning the Dark: Thoughts on Community, Calling, and the Mystery of Making* by Andrew Peterson.](https://amzn.to/2Sxftu1) This has been an incredibly encouraging and enlightening read. I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts when I'm done.

[ðŸŽ§ *The Eye of the World* by Robert Jordan.](https://amzn.to/2UVC9Wh) After years of getting recommendations for the classic Wheel of Time fantasy series, I've decided it's time to check it out. I can't write in the genre and not be familiar with such a foundational author and series.

### ðŸ“š Read

[ðŸ“– *Endure* by Alex Hutchinson.](https://amzn.to/2wmRwwR) A fascinating survey of the available research on human endurance and told with an engaging voice. If you are interested in the pursuit of human limitations, this is for you.

[ðŸ“– *Star Wars: Aftermath* by Chuck Wendig.](https://amzn.to/38A9vxX) An okay novel set after the original trilogy. The setting and plot are thoroughly Star Wars, but the characters are one dimensional and not very interesting. It's the first novel in a series, but I won't be reading further.

[ðŸ“– *Run Forever* by Amby Burfoot.](https://amzn.to/2vzsN85) Trying to get back to a steady running habit at 42 is not easy, and Burfoot has been a fixture of the running wisdom that has guided me on and off since middle school cross country. I loved his previous books and his work for *Runner's World*, and this book was no different. This book was a delightful look inside the wisdom of someone who has kept running late into life, as I hope to.
