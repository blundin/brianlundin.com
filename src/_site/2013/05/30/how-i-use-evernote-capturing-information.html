<meta name="description" content="Evernote is the most versatile tool in my digital toolbox. I use it for, what seems like, everything. I’ve heard their CEO say many times that their desire is for the service to be a &#39;second brain’ for their users. If I am any indication, they are well on their way. Why am I taking the time to write a post about a product that I have no financial stake in? Two reasons: First, I love it. I genuinely do. I am a big fan of the service and the company. They do things right, and I really appreciate that. Second, late last week I posted a piece on the blog detailing my social media workflow. While it did not exactly crash the Internet, it generated some good discussion in the comments. Several of the commenters indicated that they wanted more information on how I use Evernote. I like to think deeply about how I do what I do, so it sounded like a really good topic to explore. In this post I will cover the basics of how I use Evernote and the specifics of how I capture notes. In part two, I will show you how I organize my Evernote account. Then finally in part three, I will discuss the applications I use with Evernote. What is Evernote? First, how about short introduction for those of you unfamiliar with the service and applications? Evernote is, at it’s core, a note taking application. It gives you the ability to take a note on almost any device and then access it from any other device. This may sound very basic, and not much like a second brain, but that is because what the company has done is take this very simple idea and give it wide-ranging power. From powerful search, tagging, location, image search and integration features, to their near-ubiquity on modern PC and device operating systems, Evernote gives its users the ability to remember everything they need, and more. How do I use it? I have learned one clear thing in collaborating with and talking to other Evernote users: everyone has a different viewpoint on how to use it. It can be used in many different ways. That is the power of the service. What I detail in this series of posts is simply how I use the tools. It may not work for you, but I hope you can pick up something valuable. I work for a large IT solutions company with an appropriately strict IT security policy. As a result I do not use Evernote for work. I do not store company data in it; so my use of Evernote focuses on my personal life and side projects, of which there are many. I use Evernote to: Archive travel and event information Collect and manage recipes Collect and review articles, tips and ideas for my writing projects before they start Record interviews for my work with the Story Team Take notes, make and use flashcards, and collect materials for my work towards an advanced theology degree Contact information for networking and acquaintances As you can see, I use it for several different, specific goals. Your mileage will vary. Information capture (it’s more than just note-taking) Between all of the use cases I outlined above I use a variety of tools to capture data in Evernote. For information on the web (travel &amp; event info, recipes, articles and project research), I use the Evernote Web Clipper extensively. It may be the leading tool I use to capture data. The clipper is offered for all major browsers as an extension, and there is a bookmarklet for other browsers. I also use the option in Chrome for the clipper to search my Evernote note account when I do a Google search. This is a really useful, and little talked about, feature. Also, when reading long form articles I will use the Evernote Clearly Chrome extension for readability and to import the content into Evernote. It’s a handy little extension. In my theology classes this past year I occasionally used Skitch to capture diagrams and visual aids, but usually I did not have time while note taking to do it well. As a result, it was little used. For design collaboration it can be a great tool, but I do not rely on it heavily. I use the Evernote Mac and Windows apps for long form note taking. Whether it is in class, in meetings at church or just at home gathering information for a project, I use the PC apps extensively. I also use these apps exclusively for organizing my notes. I am careful about how I process data in Evernote, but more about that in my next post. For contact information I use Evernote Hello for iOS. I will go into this app in more detail in a later post. It is a great app for managing contacts in Evernote, and for keeping my networking and acquaintance information out of my iPhone contacts list (which is already overcrowded). For recording interviews for Story Team assignments I use both the Mac and iPhone apps. After a mishap with my phone during an interview a few years ago I have started using a backup. I capture the primary recording on my Mac via recording software and a Samson USB Go Mic. After the interview I edit the start and finish, export to an mp3 and then import it into Evernote. While the Evernote client can record it directly, I like the control and options I have with this workflow. As a backup I also record the interview on my iPhone, directly into the Evernote app. Using this process I get clean audio and have not lost another interview.

    <p>Evernote is the most versatile tool in my digital toolbox. I use it for, what seems like, everything. I’ve<br />

Then finally in part </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">three, I will discuss the applications I use with Evernote.</span></p>
<h2>What is Evernote?</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/logo.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, how about short<br />
introduction for those of you unfamiliar with the service and applications?<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is, at it’s core, a note taking application. It gives you the ability<br />
to take a note on almost any device and then access it from any other device.<br />
This may sound very basic, and not much like a second brain, but that is<br />
because what the company has done is take this very simple idea and give it<br />
wide-ranging power. From powerful search, tagging, location, image search and<br />
integration features, to their near-ubiquity on modern PC and device operating<br />
systems, Evernote gives its users the ability to remember everything they need,<br />
and more.</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have learned one clear thing<br />
in collaborating with and talking to other Evernote users: everyone has a<br />
different viewpoint on how to use it. It can be used in many different ways.<br />
That is the power of the service. What I detail in this series of posts is<br />
simply how I use the tools. It may not work for you, but I hope you can pick up<br />
something valuable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I work for a large IT solutions company with an<br />
appropriately strict IT security policy. As a result I do not use Evernote for<br />
work. I do not store company data in it; so my use of Evernote focuses on my personal<br />
life and side projects, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I use Evernote to:</p>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Archive travel and event information</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Collect and manage recipes</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Collect and review articles, tips and ideas for<br />
my writing projects before they start</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Record interviews for my work with <a href="http://austinstone.org/stories/stories-main">the Story<br />
Team</a></li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Take notes, make and use flashcards, and collect<br />
materials for my work towards an advanced theology degree</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->Contact information for networking and<br />
acquaintances</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see, I use it for<br />
several different, specific goals. Your mileage will vary.</p>
<h2>Information capture (it’s more than just note-taking)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Between all of the use cases I outlined above I use a<br />
variety of tools to capture data in Evernote.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/web_clipper-75.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For information on the web<br />
(travel &amp; event info, recipes, articles and project research), I use the<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a> extensively. It may be the leading tool I use to capture<br />
data. The clipper is offered for all major browsers as an extension, and there<br />
is a bookmarklet for other browsers. I also use the option in Chrome for the<br />
clipper to search my Evernote note account when I do a Google search. This is a<br />
really useful, and little talked about, feature. Also, when reading long form<br />
articles I will use the <a href="http://evernote.com/clearly/">Evernote Clearly Chrome extension</a> for readability and<br />
to import the content into Evernote. It’s a handy little extension.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my theology classes this<br />
past year I occasionally used <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a> to capture diagrams and visual aids, but<br />
usually I did not have time while note taking to do it well. As a result, it<br />
was little used. For design collaboration it can be a great tool, but I do not<br />
rely on it heavily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I use the <a href="http://evernote.com/evernote/">Evernote Mac and<br />
Windows apps</a> for long form note taking. Whether it is in class, in meetings at<br />
church or just at home gathering information for a project, I use the PC apps<br />
extensively. I also use these apps exclusively for organizing my notes. I am<br />
careful about how I process data in Evernote, but more about that in my next<br />
post.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://brianlundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hello-75.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For contact information I use<br />
<a href="http://evernote.com/hello/">Evernote Hello</a> for iOS. I will go into this app in more detail in a later post.<br />
It is a great app for managing contacts in Evernote, and for keeping my<br />
networking and acquaintance information out of my iPhone contacts list (which<br />
is already overcrowded).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For recording interviews for<br />
Story Team assignments I use both the Mac and iPhone apps. After a mishap with<br />
my phone during an interview a few years ago I have started using a backup. I<br />
capture the primary recording on my Mac via recording software and <a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R76D42/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001R76D42&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blundin-20">a Samson USB<br />
Go Mic</a>. After the interview I edit the start and finish, export to an mp3 and<br />
then import it into Evernote. While the Evernote client can record it directly,<br />
I like the control and options I have with this workflow. As a backup I also<br />
record the interview on my iPhone, directly into the Evernote app. Using this<br />
process I get clean audio and have not lost another interview.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, I use the iOS app to<br />
capture all physical paperwork. The image capture tools in the apps, and OCS on<br />
the Evernote servers make this a completely valid option. In fact, I have<br />
considered getting a scanner that can capture directly into the Evernote app, but<br />
the quality of the image capture and text recognition fully satisfy my<br />
requirements.</p>
<h2>Next time on the blog</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my next post I will address<br />
my process and organization techniques, and then I will cover apps in my final<br />
post of the series.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope this has been a helpful<br />
post for Evernote users, or those considering picking it up. I’m not the only<br />
user out there, and I am sure my readers have additional insight. How do you<br />
capture information in Evernote? Is there a cool tool out there I’m not aware<br />
