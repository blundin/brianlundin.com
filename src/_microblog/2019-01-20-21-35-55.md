I apologize for rushing to judgment. As more more videos of the interaction between the high school students and a Native American protestor and [this statement by one of the students](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1087137470670663680?s=12) was released, it's clear the situation was more complicated than first appeared. There is no excuse for racism, yet the evidence is not clear enough to be certain that's what was happening. It appears this group behaved very disrespectfully, but I do not know the motives of their hearts.
