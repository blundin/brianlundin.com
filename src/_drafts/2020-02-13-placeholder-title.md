I love systems. I love process. I love thinking about how things should work, and why they donâ€™t. I love solving problems and building new things. If youâ€™re into the study of personality types, Iâ€™m an ENTJ and Enneagram 8 (if you have no clue what that means, it doesn't really matterâ€”Thatâ€™s not what this is about). I care about duty and responsibilities. Not of this is about organization and order. No, itâ€™s about efficiency, effectiveness, and whatâ€™s *right*.

But hereâ€™s the downside: itâ€™s easy for me to heap guilt and shame on myself. *Especially* when it comes to my failures to uphold the duties and responsibilities I lay on myself. Itâ€™s certainly not unique, but I am my own worst critic. And when things start to go downhill, well, the momentum can build quite quickly.

But Iâ€™m not here to vent my self-pity. Instead I want to point out a certain mistake many productivity-focused people (or nerds, if you like) make when thinking about our systems.

It starts when you find a system that really works. One that scratches just the right itch in the way you manage your life. For me, that happened when I read [*Getting Things Done*](https://amzn.to/3bB35Ra). It gave me just the right framework and way of thinking to mange the absolute deluge of information, emails, tasks, and meetings that shocked me in my first corporate job out of college. It gave me a way to bring some order to the chaos I found myself in. As strange as it may sound to some, I fell in love with this tool. Because GTD is a great tool that helped me become successful in a hard spot.

But over the last decade or so that I have used it to run my life it became more than a tool. I added to it. I built and annual planning rhythm that informed and shaped everything aspect of life. I linked all of my lifeâ€™s roles and goals into a unified system that linked all the way down to my daily tasks. To me, it was a thing of beauty.

But at the same time, I unknowingly turned it into a set of expectations for success. I began to believe that if I executed my system well, I was successful at life. And if I failed at executing the system, that my life was a mess. (ðŸš¨The warning lights in your head should be flashing right now.ðŸš¨)

This is a huge problem. MASSIVE. No one could live up to that standard. Ever.

At a practical level
