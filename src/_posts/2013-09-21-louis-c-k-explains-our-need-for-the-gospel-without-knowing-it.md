In this clip Louis C.K. explains our need for the gospel to Conan O'Brien, without knowing it. Here's the key part.</p>
<blockquote><p>You need to build an ability to just be yourself and not be doing something. That's what the phones are taking away, is the ability to just sit there. That's being a person. Because underneath everything in your life there is that thing, that empty—forever empty. That knowledge that it's all for nothing and that you're alone. It's down there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I assume he does not realize, or probably agree, that the emptiness he's talking about is our need for Jesus. But that's exactly what it is. There is always a glimpse of truth in the art of this world, sometimes we have to look really hard for it. In this case we don't, because its sitting right out in the open.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't agree with his conclusion, but how he frames the problem? Dead on.</p>
