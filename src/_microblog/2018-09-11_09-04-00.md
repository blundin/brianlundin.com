There are so many interesting things going on in this poem via the Poem of the Day podcast. It lays bare the human toll of the Puerto Rican hurricane destruction and our government's neglect and deals with interesting father/son stuff. You should listen to [Letter to My Father by MartÃ­n Espada](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/146049/letter-to-my-father) ðŸ“šðŸŽ™
