"Art, a friend of mine is fond of saying, does not owe you anything. You might want a movie to contain a specific scene, or to end with your preferred conclusion. But that isnâ€™t what art does. Art exists to challenge us, to make us see the world in a new way." @alissamarie [at Vox](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/9/13/17846986/first-man-flag-controversy-noah-patriotic#click=https://t.co/WqgKpZXPh5)
