[The observations](https://blog.ayjay.org/knowledge-is-what-bwings-us-togeddah-today/) made by [@ayjay](https://micro.blog/ayjay) are well-taken:

> The more I have thought about it the more convinced I have become that Americans elected as their President the single most comprehensively disqualified public figure for the job: a man disqualified by temperament, by character, by inexperience, by vulnerability to blackmail — and by sheer ignorance.

> And it’s that last point that makes me want to call the current regime by a different name: it is, I think, an agnoiocracy — rule by the ignorant. Rule by know-nothings. Most of the people who voted for Trump are not as crassly venal as he is, but they tend to be equally ignorant. It was their ignorance (or denial — it amounts to the same thing) of the facts of our political order that made them think that Trump could be a successful president, and their ignorance of Trump’s non-televised history that made them think that he could be trusted to keep any promise that is not in his direct interest to keep.

It's not just the Trump administration and those who voted for him. The lack of basic civic knowledge is widespread on all parts of the political spectrum. The first step towards fixing our problem may just be reforming our educational approach to history and civics.
