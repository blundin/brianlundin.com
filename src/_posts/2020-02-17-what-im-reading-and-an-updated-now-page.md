Just a quick note to tell you that I’ve added a new page to the site to track what I’m reading. I try to keep up with short reviews of each book, but there’s no way I can keep up. This page will archive everything that I read going forward—good, bad, important, and not. [Check it out here,](/reading.html) or by clicking “More Topics” in the upper right of this page and going to the “Reading” page.

Also, I’ve updated my Now page with the latest updates on writing and ministry. As always, thanks for reading!
