The colophon is set for a comeback. With so many new digital publishing options, platforms and approaches, there is a natural opening and call for sites to share how they do what they do. In the spirit of [the traditional colophon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)), I offer this summary of the tools behind this site.

**Typography**

I approached the typographic design of this site with two goals in mind. First, to not slow down page load (i.e. no cloud-hosted fonts). Second, to feel natural and of a piece with the device platform. So, I am using a prioritized font stack that degrades from the preferred font down to the system fonts.

The preferred font is [Avenir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_(typeface)), and if that font is not installed, then I use this implementation of [native system fonts](https://furbo.org/2018/03/28/system-fonts-in-css/).

**Software**

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com): static blogging software
* [Atom](https://atom.io): text editor (coding)
* [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com): text editor (writing)
* [Photoshop CC](http://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshop): image and photo editing

**Hosting**

* [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/): static site hosting
* [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/): caching
