Life is hectic, and there are always more projects than time. This page contains both the things that I am focusing on right now and general life updates. If you have your own website, [you should consider adding a "now" page too](https://nownownow.com/about).

*Updated: 6/2/2019*

### Writing

I am a few weeks into a novel project that I started after my last update here. The longer fiction project that's been in the works for a while is still on the backburner, and I am totally fine with it. This new project is fun and I have a story idea I love.

The blog has not been a priority and probably won't be for awhile. And I'm okay with that, too.

### Ministry

[Story Team](http://austinstone.org/stories/) is in the midst of renewing our volunteers and considering applications for next year. This is a fun time of year to hear what God is doing in our artists lives and meet new artists. It takes a lot of energy, but I do love it.

The first year of the [Writer Development Program](https://www.austinstoneinstitute.org/what-we-do/development-programs/wdp/) is over, and I cannot believe how faithful God has been to us this year. We had wonderful students, great teachers, and my fellow coaches and leaders were amazing to work with. I am so thankful for what God has done this past year, and I am excited to continue to be a part of it next year.

### Family

Family is good. Life is hard at times with a two year old and a six month old, but we love it. This past week we were reading *The Jesus Storybook Bible* and Lily started talking about Jesus's "owies" and how people were mean to him and put him on a cross. I can't describe the feeling and do it justice. I just can't.
