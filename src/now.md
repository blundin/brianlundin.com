Life is hectic, and there are always more projects than time. This list contains the things that I am focusing on right now.

### Writing

I'm working on the first draft of a novel which I've been thinking about and planning for a long time.

I'm also in the earliest planning stages for a Lent-focused project.

### Ministry



### Family
