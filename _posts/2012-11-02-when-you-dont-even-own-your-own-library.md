<blockquote>Iâ€™m rethinking this whole buy-books-electronically thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/how-you-like-that-kindle-now/">Rod Dreher in a recent post</a> about the ebook readers in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. I'm right there with him.</p>
<p>I was a relatively early ebook adopter. I had one of the first Kindle models, and I have enjoyed it earnestly. I have also spent hundreds of dollars investing in a sizable digital theological library. The ease of carrying a whole library on one device, the ability to have all my books on my Kindle, iPad or iPhone at the drop of a hat, and the savings it typically brought over paper books captured my love and devotion from day one. But in the last few weeks, I am seriously starting to rethink things.</p>
<p>In the post referenced above, Rod relates his recent travel troubles with his iPad to position that the folks in Sandy-affected areas are in. If your device breaks, you cant get on the internet, or there is no power you have effectively lost your library. No matter what the likelihood of this is, the fact remains, this will not happen to your paper&nbsp;library.  But these two examples are not even the worst side of my newly acquired ebook dilemma.</p>
<p>What if Amazon decided one day that you were no longer a&nbsp;legitimate&nbsp;customer? What if your account was hacked and used for an illegal transaction, or theft, or something worse? What would they do? Well, <a href="#">due to the unfortunate circumstances of a Norwegian woman named Linn</a>, we now know:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Linn travels a lot and therefore has, or should I say had, a lot of books on her Kindle, purchased from Amazon. Suddenly, her Kindle was wiped and her account was closed. Being convinced that something wrong had happened, she sent an e-mail to Amazon, asking for help. This was the answer:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>Dear Linn [last name],</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>My name is Michael Murphy and I represent Executive Customer Relations within Amazon.co.uk. One of our mandates is to address the most acute account and order problems, and in this capacity your account and orders have been brought to my attention.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We have found your account is directly related to another which has been previously closed for abuse of our policies. As such, your Amazon.co.uk account has been closed and any open orders have been cancelled.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Per our Conditions of Use which state in part: Amazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Please know that any attempt to open a new account will meet with the same action.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You may direct any questions to me at resolution-uk@amazon.co.uk.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for your attention to this email.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Regards</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Michael Murphy<br>Executive Customer Relations<br>Amazon.co.uk</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there you have it. The post goes to recount a long series of back and forth correspondence on the issue. Sadly, it ends with no answers from Amazon and their promise to close any new account she opens.</p>
<p>This leads me to my dilemma. If I cannot ensure access to my library, or if the one who sold me the volumes in my library has the right and&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to summarily&nbsp;repossess&nbsp;the contents of my library, then is it even mine?</p>
<p>In a real sense, do I even <em>own</em> the ebooks that I have purchased? Logically the answer appears to be no.</p>
<p>In light of this, I can honestly say that I may not buy another ebook. That is a very big statement for me, especially in light of the fact that I was considering self-publishing some work via the Kindle platform just a few weeks ago. From where I sit now, that seems a long ways off.</p>
