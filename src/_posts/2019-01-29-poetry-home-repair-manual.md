Ted Kooser was Poet Laureate of The United States from 2004-2006. He is a professor of English at The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, although for years he worked as an executive in the insurance industry, because even the best poets must have day jobs. Heâ€™s a Pulitzer Prize-winner and has published many collections of poetry. And with *The Poetry Home Repair Manual* he wrote one of the most approachable, practical, and joyful books on poetry that Iâ€™ve yet run across. 

A friend of mine recommended this book to me a while back when I started to write poetry, and I was intrigued by the title right away. Who writes a book for beginning poets and styles the name as a home repair manual? Well, only a few pages in, this reader got it. The book is a repair manual. In it, Kooser will not teach you the basics of verse, rhyme, or rhythm. He does not lecture about forms. Of course, this is all ground that he covers, and he covers it well. But he does not do so in an academic or theoretical way. Instead he approaches poetry as he would a broken lawnmower, or dishwasher. He helps the reader see whatâ€™s wrong, and then instructs you how to fix it by demonstrating *how* it works. This unusual title is the perfect one for this book.

The book is a casual read, more than that it's a joyful read. Kooser is not only a good teacher, but he is a great curator. He uses wonderful poems (more of other poets than his own, by my estimation) to illustrate his points. And some of the gems I discovered in this slim little book would have made reading this book worth it on their own. One great example is this poem by Frank Steele:
