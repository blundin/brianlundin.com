The beauty of Advent is the hopeful expectation from a promise fulfilled.
<p>â€œCome now, let us reason together, says the LORD:<br/>
though your sins are like scarlet,<br/>
&#8195;they shall be as white as snow;<br/>
though they are red like crimson,<br/>
&#8195;they shall become like wool."<br/>
Isaiah 1:18</p>
