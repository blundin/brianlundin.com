One my favorite things about Apple Music is their Essentials playlists. They are a great reminder of why I loved bands that aren&#39;t in my regurlar rotation. Some days a good Essentials playlist like [this one for the Silversun Pickups is just right](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/silversun-pickups-essentials/pl.15cf3025c8944cc392f1d8e587d5afef).
