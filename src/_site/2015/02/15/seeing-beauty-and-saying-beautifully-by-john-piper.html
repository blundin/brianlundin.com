Lewis</i> by John Piper</a> is a short, powerful and inspiring shot to the heart for any lover of words and Jesus. It’s one of the most fulfilling books I’ve read in a while, and one that left me wanting more.</p>

<p>Piper sews a common thread through the works of three great Christian Englishmen, namely that <em>proclaiming</em> the gospel of Christ beautifully helps us <em>see</em> him more beautifully. It’s a powerful assertion that he backs up clearly, and one that invites the reader to join these three giants.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert">George Herbert</a> was a 16th century country pastor and poet, seen by scholars as an immensely pivotal figure in the history of English poetry. His works, published posthumously and published continually since, are entirely focused on his faith and devotion to Christ.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield">George Whitefield</a> was an 18th century English preacher and key figure in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Great_Awakening">the Great Awakening</a> in both Britain and the American colonies. He preached an enormous number of sermons, an impossible number actually. Piper estimates that for many weeks of his life, actually preached for sixty hours a week. As Piper points out, for most of his career, Whitefield spoke more than he slept.</p>

<p>The most well known of these three men to readers today is of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a>. Lewis was the foremost spokesman for British Christianity in the mid-20th century. He was an awe-inspiring public intellectual, taking <em>three</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First-class_honours">First Class Honors</a> at Oxford, the top expert of Medieval English literature in the world, and a best-selling novelist.</p>

<p>Piper starts the book with an extended discussion of eloquence, particularly what kinds of eloquence either honor Christ or elevate the speaker and dishonor the cross. In turn, he then takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of each these three mens’ autobiographies, theologies, and professional lives, then settles into a different aspect of their work, each on this common thread of proclaiming the beauties of Christ.</p>

<p>This book is a must read in my mind for any Christian who is a writer, speaker, pastor, poet or avid reader. Even if you do not see yourself in any of these categories, I would commend this book to you. The illustrations draw from each of these men’s work will stretch your understanding of beauty in words, and your imagination of the glories of Christ. It’s an inspiring read that prompted me to pick up the pen and expend more poetic effort myself.</p>
