<p>Rod Dreher has <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/1931-follies-redivivus/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=1931-follies-redivivus">a great post</a> on something I have been thinking about a lot lately:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I never have read economics knowledgeably or in depth, but I took it on trust that our economists were right about these things. Capitalism had triumphed, and the only real argument was between conservatives and neoliberals. Yes, social conservatives like me pointed out how an economic order that puts too much emphasis on the market undermines certain things social conservatives value, but most of us, </span><span class="s2"><strong>I would say in retrospect, never really understood the depth of what it meant to say, as the Bible absolutely does, that wealth corrupts. I mean, we did not fully appreciate how the acquisition of money — which is to say, power — created a sense of invulnerability, and blinded us to the dangers inherent in the system we supported.</strong></span><span class="s1"> We on the American Right may look at the Eurozone bigs today and think, “Well, of course; how could they not have seen that coming?” But very damn few of us — and not just on the Right (cough, cough, Robert Rubin) — saw our own epistemic corruption. <em>(emphasis added)</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p2">Well said.</p>
