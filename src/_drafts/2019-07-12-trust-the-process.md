I discovered the book [Getting Things Done by David Allen](https://amzn.to/2CyfcxN) about 15 years ago, and it has had immeasurable impact on my work life right away. I had been trying a goals and prioritization-based time management approach for the first several years of my career and it was not going well. I simply could not keep up with the volume of email, tasks, alerts, and more than flowed my way each day. I was literally drowning in email and project notes. I needed a better way, and I discovered GTD.

The methodology that David Allen outlined in GTD was really valuable, it’s still the backbone of my workflow today, but that is not the most valuable thing I learned from the book. **The most important thing I learned was the value of a trusted system**. One of the main tenets of GTD is to have a limited number of inboxes where you know that anything that enters that inbox will be looked at and evaluated soon. What’s value in having trusted inboxes? Because once you do trust them, you can put anything in those boxes and you *know* it will get dealt with. And then, you can stop thinking about it. Because you trust that it will be handled. This was an enormously freeing technique for me to learn. With this approach in hand I could sit down with a huge inbox full of emails, make quick decisions, and know that nothing that needed to be addressed would be dropped. It felt like a superpower.

A few years later, my life had taken some pretty interesting—some good, some very bad—twists and turns. Around 2009 I found myself coming back to following Jesus and going to church. I was reading my Bible a lot more, and discovering deeper theology than I had previously known. I spent a lot of time in the book of Romans. It was there I learned about another process.

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. 
> Romans 8:28-30

The Christian life is miraculous—it takes a miracle to bring spiritual rebirth to the human heart—but it is also a process. From predestination, to calling, to justification, to glorification, this process describes how God brings the believer from being an enemy to becoming a co-heir with His Son. And notice that no one is left behind. “Those whom he,” is repeated at each step. There are none left out.

As I was healed more and more from my sin and I grew in spiritual maturity, this lesson grew even larger in my mind. Just like with handling work emails and projects, I learned that if I trusted the process—and God—that change would come. That I would move closer and closer to my goals. Trusting the process became part of how I thought about growth.

A few years later, I came to another significant \<writing and process\>
