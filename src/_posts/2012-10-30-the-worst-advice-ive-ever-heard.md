<p>What is the worst advice you have ever heard? How about this?</p>
<h3 class="text-align-center">Do what makes you happy</h3>
<p>Or, its corollary:</p>
<h3 class="text-align-center">Follow your heart/feelings</h3>
<p>I was prompted to consider this question by Rod Dreher's blog where he quoted this post. The question struck me hard because I realized this advice, this line of thinking, is the prevalent worldview of our day. And it is utterly destructive.</p>
<p>Following this advice will wreck a marriage over time, or all in one moment. Following this advice will lead you to ignore your responsibilities and obligations. It will erode your sense of duty to family, community and even yourself. This advice will destroy you, and what you love.</p>
<p>I'm sure some of you are not sold. I get it, it's a really hard sell these days. Everything in our society, philosophy, and media are telling you this is not true. They earnestly, and deftly, push the idea that if you would just follow your own feelings, and let others do the same, that we'd find ourselves in one big happy, tolerant culture-- and that everything would be fine.</p>
<p>Just one problem; <em>it's all a lie</em>.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself one question, and answer it honestly. <em>What is the worst thing I have wanted to do today?</em> Nothing today? How about yesterday? Last week? This month? If you are honest with yourself-- deep, deep down where no one else will ever know you-- you will find some ugly stuff.</p>
<p>Still maintain that's not you? Okay fine, how do you think your spouse would answer that question? Your neighbor? Your boss? Your nemesis? You won't make it very far without finding some very dark desires.</p>
<p>That is the point. You can't trust your heart, mind, or feelings-- not all the times. This is why culture matters. Having friends, family, and a community around that holds us to a certain moral standard keeps us in line. Because we won't do it on our own. Culture matters. Community matters. Morality matters.</p>
