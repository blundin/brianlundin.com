[![“Keep Going” by Austin Kleon](/images/posts/2020-03-02--10-35-06.jpg){: .img-fluid}](https://amzn.to/2ThjqTK)

My wife has gotten used to all sorts of small creative experiments and exercises that I’ve taken up over the years. From fiddling with a Rubik’s cube to occasional collaging, and now to a steady flow of ideas for how to get our little ones engaged in making art, she entertains them all. And she’s eve stopped asking where they come from. Because she knows they almost always originate from the books and [blog of Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com).

I’ve been a fan of Kleon’s since [his first book, *Steal Like an Artist*](https://amzn.to/38hiiUH) was published in 2012. It came out at an interesting time for me, one where I had been writing again for several years and starting to grapple with what that meant. To be honest it gave me a whole new view into what being a writer could—and perhaps should—be. It profoundly shaped my creative process and the way I thought about making art. His next book was influential as well, but not to the same degree (though that’s a really high bar, to be honest). Needless to say, I was looking for to his latest effort.

[*Keep Going* did not disappoint.](https://amzn.to/2ThjqTK) I sat down yesterday and read it in two sittings. And I will be reading it again almost immediately.

Kleon’s message is simple, and unsurprisingly right in the title. When you are an artist, what matters is that you keep working. And after [the year I had last year](https://brianlundin.com/blog/on-the-anniversary-of-my-blog-falling-silent.html), that’s exactly what I needed to hear. But it’s not that message that matters in this book, it is the practical and yet inspiring way that Kleon advises his fellow artists to follow that is so helpful. In the book he gives us 10 ways that an artist can persevere, day after day. These bits of guidance range from “Every Day is Groundhog Day” to “When in Doubt, Tidy Up.” But this book is not just full of practical advice. Kleon does something all too rare in the world of creativity, productivity, or (dare I say) self-help books, he manages to point the reader from the practicals to the bigger, philosophical issues at play. He does not start with some big, grand theory. Instead he starts with the practical, and leads the reader to bigger insights.

It was with this book that I realized Kleon is (accidentally?) building a fully fleshed out philosophical approach to creativity in the 21st century. *Steal Like an Artist* explains how artists and their voices are shaped and made. *Show Your Work* wrestles with the difficulties of getting art into the world, but shows why the struggle is worth it. And in this installment, Kleon urges artists to persevere and equips them with a mindset and the tools to do so.


I am probably not an objective reviewer when it comes to this author, but I don’t really care. This book was immensely helpful and if you need a little push to keep making things, [you should definitely pick it up](https://amzn.to/2ThjqTK).
