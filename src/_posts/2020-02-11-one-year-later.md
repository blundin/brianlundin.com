It’s been exactly one year since I posted anything to this blog. Before that, I put up [a post explaining that my theme for 2019 was the “Year of Rebooting”](https://brianlundin.com/blog/year-of-rebooting.html). I expected to follow up on that post often over the course of the year with my thoughts on productivity and planning, sort of proving out a method as I pursed developing it. Obviously that didn’t happen.

I realized shortly after posting my plans to return to blogging that I was in no shape to teach anyone else about planning and productivity. In fact, I wasn’t in any sort of good shape. I was depressed. I could barely motivate myself to take care of the basic requirements of work and family life. How in the world did I think I could teach anyone anything about planning wisely and being productive? So I didn’t write for my blog. I didn’t work on a new system. Instead I went to work on my actual theme, Rebooting. And over the last year there has been a ton of progress.

My depression was circumstantial and lasted only for a season. It was a long season—over a year—but I came out of it. I was quite surprised when I first realized I was depressed. It  explained so much, and yet the explanation itself was disquieting. But through the help of my wife, a great counselor, friends, and more than anyone Jesus, I came to understand and accept the place I found myself in. It wasn’t permanent, but it was real. And that allowed me to address what had gone sideways, where I failed, and where I was tossed around without any control.

There’s that word. “Control.” It explains so much of my desire to be productive, useful, prolific, and respected. I want to control everything. Of course for a Christian this should be no surprise. It’s rooted in the same desire that produced sin in the garden: a desire to be like God. And more than anything, recent history has shown me that not only am I not god-like, even if I was I’d make a really crappy god. And so, a big part of my healing process has been letting go. Letting go of unrealistic plans. Letting go of envy. Admitting that my desires are not wholly pure, and that I really want is to control, to rule, and to reign.

Which brings me to the point I sat down to make. Planning and systems are good things. They help us understand how to accomplish goals and how to achieve worthy ends. Learning how to plan and execute is critical to having a meaningful and (actually) productive life. But no amount of planning can guarantee it. No system, or philosophy, or technique can deliver perfection. And yet that is what I (and I’m guessing some of you) really want. We want to control. We want things our way. And then, it would be perfect. 

But we can’t. We cannot control everything. We cannot meet all of our own expectations. And we cannot make things right. And it’s a good thing too, because I would make a terrible god.

So, sitting here at the end of the Year of Rebooting I don’t have some grand new system. I don’t have a plan that I am confident in.
