Life is hectic, and there are always more projects than time. This page contains both the things that I am focusing on right now and general life updates. If you have your own website, [you should consider adding a "now" page too](https://nownownow.com/about).

### Writing

I've written a bit about this publicly, but I have really fallen in love with poetry lately. I've been reading a lot, writing a good bit of it, and I plan on posting more about it in the coming months. I've also picked back up my novel project, along with a collaboration that I'm not talking about yet, but can't wait to share. 2020 has been a good year so far for my writing, and I'm excited about the future for the first time in awhile.

Also, last fall I launched a newsletter about storytelling, creativity, and culture. [It's called The Narrative, and you should check it out](https://thenarrative.substack.com). I'm hoping to get back to publishing new issues this spring

### Ministry

Story Team is really rolling! Our new volunteers this year have been killing it, and I'm looking forward to sharing some of our stories with you. Here are a few of my favorite so far:

- [*A Faithful Sower*](https://austinstone.org/resources/stories/written/?sapurl=LytlZGM3L2xiL21pLys3M3ZrenM2P2JyYW5kaW5nPXRydWUmZW1iZWQ9dHJ1ZQ==)
- [*The Healing of Elishua Grace*](https://austinstone.org/resources/stories/written/?sapurl=LytlZGM3L2xiL21pLytwejQ5djM2P2JyYW5kaW5nPXRydWUmZW1iZWQ9dHJ1ZQ==)
- [*He Loved Her When*](https://austinstone.org/resources/stories/written/?sapurl=LytlZGM3L2xiL21pLyt5cHltYzR2P2JyYW5kaW5nPXRydWUmZW1iZWQ9dHJ1ZQ==)

We also released the first film I directed. This was a huge effort, and I am forever indebted to Hunter Sprague for his work editing this film. Any credit for its success definitely lies with him. [You can see the film, *Artfully Created*, here](https://austinstone.org/resources/stories/?sapurl=LytlZGM3L2xiL21pLys0NWY0MndqP2JyYW5kaW5nPXRydWUmZW1iZWQ9dHJ1ZQ==).

### Family

Everything is great! Our little girls are growing and learning, and we are really enjoying our time with them. We're just praying for the right minivan to come along for us to upgrade to!
