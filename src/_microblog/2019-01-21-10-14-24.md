![The Martin Luther King, Jr. March in Taylor, TX](https://brianlundin.com/images/microblog/2019-01-21_10-14-34.jpeg){: .img-fluid}
The Taylor, Texas Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration always kicks off with a march from Robinson Park to City Hall. I was pleased to see so many people out today, even more than last year!
