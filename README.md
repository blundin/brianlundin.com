# brianlundin.com

This is the repository for my website at [brianlundin.com](https://brianlundin.com). The site is a static site built using [Jekyll](https:.\//jekyllrb.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). Maybe you will find it useful in setting up your own site.

## Goals

My goals in building this site as a static HTML, CSS, and Javascript are straightforward:
1. I want to code my site myself to maintain control over the quality of the HTML and what dependencies are used
2. I do not want to mess with complicated hosting setups
3. I want to keep it cheap
4. I want to keep my web and development skills sharp, even though that is no longer my job

## Dependencies

There are a number of dependencies used in this project:
- Bootstrap: front-end toolkit
- Jekyll: static site generator
- jekyll-easy-images: Jekyll plugin for making responsive images easy to use in blog posts
- Gulp: a really handy Javascript-based build system
- Several Gulp plugins to manage the build process
