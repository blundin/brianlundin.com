Sadly [there is a lot of truth in this article from @edstetzer](https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/complementarians-closed-rooms-aimee-byrd-beth-moore.html).  Using your theology to excuse, or even worse motivate, gossip and slander is wicked. It harms the church, grieves Jesus, and hurts our sisters in Christ.
![Quote from Ed Stetzer: “what both of these situations show is that the Venn diagram of reformed, complementarian, and misogynist has a pretty significant overlap that some people of character—men and women together—need to address in those movements. That at least involves the OPC and PCA, and from my up-close and personal observations, plenty of spaces in the SBC.”](https://brianlundin.com/images/microblog/2020-06-20--07-22-48.jpeg){: .img-fluid}
