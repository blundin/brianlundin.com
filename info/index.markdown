<p>Brian Lundin is a storyteller, writer, and geek who lives in Austin, TX. He is passionate about Jesus, literature, writing, and telling stories of redemption in the lives of God's people. He is a partner at the Austin Stone Community Church, and leads the writing team for <a href="http://storyteam.org">the Austin Stone Story Team</a>.</p>
<p>Brian went to school at Oklahoma State University to study journalism, but he graduated with an MIS degree in 2001. Brian is an IT Strategist and manages communications at a leading technology solutions company.</p>
<p>He loves his OSU Cowboys, good beer, an evening with a book on theology-- and an occasional video game now and then. He is feverishly working to convert his future wife to being a Cowboy fan; so far bribery with new orange clothes has been the most effective method.</p>
