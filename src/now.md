Life is hectic, and there are always more projects than time. This page contains both the things that I am focusing on right now and general life updates. If you have your own website, [you should consider adding a "now" page too](https://nownownow.com/about).

### Writing

I recent launched a newsletter for people who care about storytelling, creativity, and culture. [It's called The Narrative, and you should check it out](https://thenarrative.substack.com). I'm really enjoying writing it, and the initial feedback feedback has been encouraging. I've got some big ideas in mind for the future, which I hope to start releasing soon.

In my last update to this page I mentioned that I started a new fiction project. Well, I've shelved it for reasons that [I wrote about in the last issue of my newsletter](https://thenarrative.substack.com/p/it-wasnt-my-idea-it-was-better).

### Ministry

We kicked off the year for [Story Team](http://austinstone.org/stories/) with a bunch of new volunteers. I'm really excited about the stories we are working on right now, and I can't wait to release them to our church. The upcoming Story Sunday on September 15th is going to be really good, and I am humbled and grateful to work with such talented folks.

We've completed interviews for this year's [Writer Development Program](https://www.austinstoneinstitute.org/what-we-do/development-programs/wdp/) at The Austin Stone is over, and I am looking forward to getting back to teaching writers. There was so much growth in our writers. We saw everyone grow in their craft and several writers stepped into serving the church with the Austin Stone Institute and Story Team. The second year of this program is going to be great!

### Family

Lindsey started a new part-time role with The Austin Stone as the editor for the ASI team. She will have her hands on so many projects that will equip and develop our church. I'm really proud of her, and she is going to do a great job! We've got a lot of exciting change in the Lundin house!
