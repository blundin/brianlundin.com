<p>The <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">'This American Life' podcast</a> might be the best showcase of storytelling on the internet, and it's definitely the best of public radio. I love their work and recommend the show to anyone interested in telling or consuming stories.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, they upped their game. They launched a new podcast, '<a href="http://serialpodcast.org">Serial</a>.' From the summary of <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/season-one/1/the-alibi">the first episode</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's Baltimore, 1999. Hae Min Lee, a popular high-school senior, disappears after school one day. Six weeks later detectives arrest her classmate and ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, for her murder. He says he's innocent - though he can't exactly remember what he was doing on that January afternoon. But someone can. A classmate at Woodlawn High School says she knows where Adnan was. The trouble is, she’s nowhere to be found.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first three episodes have been released, and they are great. Truly great. Please subscribe, both for your benefit and in hopes that this projects success will lead to more efforts like it.</p>
