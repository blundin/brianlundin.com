Life is hectic, and there are always more projects than time. This page contains both the things that I am focusing on right now and general life updates. If you have your own website, [you should consider adding a "now page" too](https://nownownow.com/about).

### Writing

I'm working on the first draft of a novel which I've been thinking about and planning for a long time. It's been a long road, but I'm excited about it.

I'm also in the earliest planning stages for a Lent-focused project.

### Ministry

[Story Team](https://austinstone.org/stories) has several exciting projects in the works:
* A congregational readings project for use in our liturgy
* Our regular rhythm of [written stories](https://austinstone.org/stories/written)
* We are finishing up the first documentary film that I directed

This fall we launched the [Writer Development Program](https://www.austinstoneinstitute.org/what-we-do/development-programs/wdp/) in partnership with The Austin Stone Institute. We are seeing really positive feedback from participants, and the material our combined team is creating is phenomenal. I'm very excited about it!

Finally, I'm still plugging away at seminary. I'm probably on track, if I bothered to do the math to figure out what the track looks like. ðŸ˜‰

### Family

This month we welcomed our second daughter into the family. Everyone is healthy and settling into our new existence as a party of four.
