A new piece of software or new notebook alone can&#39;t make your writing better. Let&#39;s be honest, good tools are great. Tools help writers out. They can help us out a lot, in fact. But good tools won&#39;t make you a good writer. They can make you more efficient or faster, and they may even make your words look better on the screen or page.

What I have learned in my various excursions into the writers&#39; marketplace? Every software or supplies purchase I&#39;ve made, and will make, is based on one of two impulses: a physical requirement to complete a project, or a hope that it would make the project better. Sadly, there have been far more of the latter. In the era of web magazines, social media and self-publishing, I believe every writer can benefit from using the right toolset for the job.
