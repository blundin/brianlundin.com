<p>A little under two months from now I will be marrying the love of my life. I truly cannot wait for that day. We are going through pre-marital counseling at The Stone and we are learning so much, and we are blessed by the mentor couple we are working with.</p>
<p>One of the things we will be undertaking to document our marriage through <a href="http://thelundinfamily.com">a blog</a>. We are planning on blogging every single day for the first year.</p>
<p>It’s a tall order, but we both love to write and have a desire to document and share what we learn during the first year of our marriage. It’s a bit of an experiment, but I think it’s exciting and I’m looking forward to getting started.</p>
