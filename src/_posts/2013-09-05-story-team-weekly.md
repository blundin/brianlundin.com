For 3 years we published our stories on the back of the bulletin for our church body, with a longer edit on the web a few days later. Now, we will not publish the shorter version in the bulletin anymore, but instead we will focus on publishing digitally.</p>
<p>For our church body to continue receiving these powerful stories of redemption, we added an email list to our process. <a href="http://bit.ly/StoryTeamWeekly">You can sign up here to receive the latest story from our team every Sunday</a>. I hope you do.</p>
<p>I'm excited for this change. It will definitely change the way our church engages with our work, but it also opens up our stories to the wider world. It also frees us up to explore interesting new ways of telling and publishing stories. This change I know that this has prompted a wave of new ideas and approaches that we are exploring. I hope to write about our transition more on this blog.</p>
