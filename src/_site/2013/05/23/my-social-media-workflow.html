<meta name="description" content="Earlier this week, I sat down with a friend who had some questions about social media. His wife is a painter who wants to broaden her exposure and participation in social media, but was (rightly) mystified about how to wade into the morass of social networks, sites and tools. He just wanted to chat about how to navigate these waters. After making it clear I was not an expert, but just a fellow traveller a bit farther down the road, we had a long conversation. I hope it was helpful, and it prompted me to finish off this long-pending blog post. If you are like me, you do not use social media for cat memes and passive-aggressive status updates, but to find new and interesting things from new and interesting people. The Internet is a big place though, and trying to find good stuff is hard work. Plus, I like to share what I find. I like to comment on what I find, and share my thoughts with like minded people. There are so many apps, sites and social media networks with significant numbers of users, and this poses a real problem. How do I find good content? How do I save long articles to read later, digest, or blog about? How do I share valuable links and articles with friends, colleagues and followers, where they are on the web? But the most important question is this: how do I do all of this while still maintaining a marriage, a job, writing projects, and my healthy addiction to books? Well, the answer is certainly &quot;not as easily as I would hope&quot;, but I have developed an efficient system that maximizes spare time and allows me to process a lot of new ideas. That is my goal: finding new ideas. Exposure to new, varied and creative thinking is the fertilizer for my own creative work. That is the point. But now, let&#39;s get down to brass tacks, what tools do I use, and what do I use them for? After the diagram below, I will break this process down into three stages: gathering, processing, and sharing. [caption id=&quot;attachment_67&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;566&quot;] My social media workflow[/caption] Gathering This is the most critical part of my process. My main goal for engaging in social media is learning. If I am not gathering good content, from diverse sources, then nothing else that follows will matter. However, this part is also the least complicated and possibly the most immature. What I use: Twitter: Quickly scan and gather links from a large set of influencers Feedly: RSS reader for daily reading of blogs Processing This is a big part of my process, and the single unifying point. I use one tool alone for this start of this step, Pocket. For a long time I used Instapaper, and I am still fond of that service, but I have found that Pocket is the most useful reading list application. Pocket integrates with every other application in my workflow. From within the app I can easily share a quote and a link to the content to the network of my choice. If I want to save anything I have viewed for reference later, I send it straight to Evernote from Pocket. I use Evernote extensively. It is almost my second brain in many ways. What I use for processing: Pocket: Save articles and video to view later. From here I decide what to blog about or share Evernote: My second brain. I use it to remember and track almost everything in my personal and writing lives Sharing This final step is not my priority, but only because I made it so easy to share. As I said below, I share straight from within Pocket, and I use Buffer to help manage multiple sites. I have three categories for my sharing activities (because I LOVE categories!): social sharing, public research and blogging. The social sharing is exactly what it sounds like, sharing on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. The only special here is that I target each post to a site based on the topic. Twitter gets almost everything, I only post to LinkedIn content that is related to the tech field, and Facebook gets very little except the occasional blog post. Buffer is a great app that lets you schedule your posts to various social media sites. This allows me to ensure there is a consistent flow of posts. One of the keys to building a following online is consistency, and Buffer allows me to keep it up. One caution, try not to blast the exact same content to all networks. The same stuff, posted everywhere and too often, is boring. Also, you can pair Buffer with Tweriod to ensure that your tweets are posted at times where your followers are most active. It’s pretty slick. Public research is an idea I picked up from Austin Kleon, and I use Tumblr for this just like he does. Essentially I post the raw material for things that I am researching or thinking about for my writing projects. I don’t write long pieces there, or really even tie things together. I simply post the stuff that I discover, and I use it to drive my research. Blogging is self-explanatory. I use this site to post things that I care about and I am thinking about. I am taking the site in a more writing focused direction, and a lot of stuff that I discover via social media is worked into the content posted here. What I use for sharing: Buffer: I use this tool to schedule and spread out tweets and posts to Facebook and LinkedIn Twitter: Twitter is my main outlet for sharing links. A link and a quote is the typical form my tweets take Facebook: I rarely share things here. It is a personal site, and many of my friends aren’t the prime audience for the topics I write or share about. Blog posts will show up here occasionally LinkedIn: This is the outlet for tech and social media related content. I don’t know how valuable this is honestly, so the content posting here is thin Tumblr: While Tumblr has the reputation as a haven for .gifs and 14-year-old brats, I use it for public research Squarespace: This is my blog. I am happy with Squarespace, well as happy as I ever am with a blogging platform. This is always a source of constant churn for me Finally It is a bit funny to read this post. It looks like I was more intentional in crafting this workflow than I really was in the beginning. It evolved over time and experimentation, and with influence from the very social networks I reference above. This works for me, and with a minimum time investment. Putting in some time to construct a logical workflow was really worth it for me. I’d love to know your thoughts, Internet. Do you have suggestions? Are there tools I’ve missed?

<p class="MsoNormal">This is the most critical part of my process. My main goal for engaging in social media is learning.

<p class="MsoNormal">It is a bit funny to read this post. It looks like I was more intentional in crafting this workflow than I really was in the beginning. It evolved over time and experimentation, and with influence from the very social networks I reference above. This works for me, and with a minimum time investment. Putting in some time to construct a logical workflow was really worth it for me.</p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts, Internet. Do you have suggestions? Are there tools I’ve missed? Post a comment below!</p>
