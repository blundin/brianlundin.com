Just a quick note to tell you that I’ve added a new page to the site to track what I’m reading. I try to keep up with short reviews of each book, but there’s no way I can keep up. This page will archive everything that I read going forward—good, bad, important, and not. [Check it out here,](/reading.html) or by clicking “More Topics” in the upper right of this page and going to the “Reading” page.

Also, I’ve updated my [Now page with the latest updates on writing and ministry](/now.html). As always, thanks for reading!
